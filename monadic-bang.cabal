-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:           GHC plugin to desugar ! into do-notation

-- A longer description of the package.
description:        A plugin for GHC which takes expressions prefixed with a !
                    and effectively takes them out of their monadic context, by
                    either creating a do-block around them or using an existing
                    do-block surrounding the expression. Inspired by Idris's
                    !-notation.
